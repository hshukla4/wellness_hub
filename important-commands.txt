#Removes unwanted packages from requirements.txt, keeps only those packages which are imported
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip freeze > requirements.txt
pipreqs app --force --savepath cleaned_requirements.txt

#First line is required only if you already have installed those packages in venv earlier
#I needed this because I had used requirements.txt for earlier with those packages installed in venv
#But now I wanted to install those packages in requirements-dev.txt

#So I did that using the following command
pip uninstall black flake8 pytest pre-commit mypy isort pylint -y
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
